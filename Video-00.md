## Video 00 - introduction of the course


Hi my name is Syd Amir and in this course we wanna to learn programming secrets //

The fundamental, intermediate, advanced and such as this topics is enough //

Lets create a charming projects with most modern web technologies, a real and good one //

So beyond the project we going to learn techniques that good programmer used in our project //

You canâ€™t find this such as techniques in fundamental courses //


OSINT is very hot in these days //

So let clone an OSINT project // that write in the worst form // in as accepted level we can //

We wanna to use react for frontend //

Actually write react code in typescript way //

We will consider a JSON file as a database in frontend //

We make this file very big //

As big as it forced us to push it in the backend //

In backend we use Node JS //

Actually write NodeJS code in typescript way //

We are trying to implement full CRUD data action with this JSON file //

Did you know that we recreating database concept just simple as that //

According to my experience of several teaching courses the database is always one of the most complicated aspect in learning programming //

My experience says the best way to learn databases is to recreate it from scratch //

What is exactly we want to do to this JSON file //

When we boring from JSON moving data to Postgresql  //

First we send data to frontend with REST API //

And then connecting two side to GraphQL //

At the end of the project we recreate UI and UX of the project with the help of Amir Hossein //

We just learn to leverage user experience and show that how much it can be different if we change the UX
